	<p>
	She was 20 when started acting. She grew up loving to escape in tv shows where life seemed funnier. When the opportunity presented itself for her to be on her first tv show, she jumped at the chance. It tickled her to see her name on tv as she was just a farmers daughter from Indiana. 
	And then once she saw her name in lights outside of a movie theatre she knew there was no turning back. She would do whatever she could for those moment of pure elation at seeing her face on the big screen. 
	She has completed four tv show and sixteen movies and now she is starting a new adventure in Web Design.
